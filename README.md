My lab partner Tavonga Tafuma and I, for our final project in our embedded systems class, developed Infinite Asteroids, a scrolling asteroid avoidance game interfacing with a FRDM-KL46Z development board to move a spaceship side to side by tilting the board. We used a Python module called Pygame to develop the game mechanics, layout, and design, and we used a C program to map the accelerometer values to x positions in the game and create a reset button. We sent this data over a USB port to the board.
